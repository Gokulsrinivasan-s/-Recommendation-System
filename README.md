Movie Recommendation System:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

In this project, you will create a Recommendation System—a model that suggests items (like movies, products, books, etc.) to users based on their interests.

For example:

If a user liked Iron Man and The Avengers, the system might recommend Spider-Man.

Similar to how Netflix, Amazon, or Spotify give suggestions.

You’ll use Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization to build your model.

USED TECHNOLOGIES:

Tool/Library	Purpose
Python	Programming
pandas	To read and handle datasets
NumPy	For numeric operations
sklearn / Surprise / LightFM	For building recommendation models
Jupyter Notebook	For writing and running the code
matplotlib / seaborn	(Optional) For data visualizations

If you're using Surprise or LightFM, they are special libraries designed for recommender systems.

VISUALIZATION:

You can show:

A sample of top recommended items for a user

A heatmap or matrix view of user-item ratings

A bar chart showing rating distribution

Example Visualization:

markdown
Copy
Edit
User123 → Recommended Movies:
1. Inception
2. The Matrix
3. Interstellar
Or a matrix like this:

Movie A	Movie B	Movie C
U1	5	?	4
U2	4	3	?

OBJECTIVE:

Use a dataset with users, items (like movies/products), and ratings

Train a model using:

Collaborative Filtering (based on user behavior)

OR Matrix Factorization (to find patterns in user-item matrix)

Recommend items to users they haven't rated yet

Evaluate how good your recommendations are

OUTCOME:

Build a Recommendation System that can suggest items to users

Learn how Netflix, Amazon, or Flipkart build their recommendation engines

Understand how to use user-item interaction data

Have a Jupyter Notebook or small app that:

Shows recommendations for users

Displays accuracy or evaluation metrics
